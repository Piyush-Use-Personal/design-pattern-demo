# Design Patterns in Software Development

Welcome to the **Design Patterns in Software Development** repository! ðŸš€

This repository contains a collection of examples and implementations of various design patterns used in software development. It explores real-world scenarios where design patterns help solve common problems, making your code cleaner, more maintainable, and scalable. Whether you're dealing with messy code, trying to streamline tests, or designing robust APIs, this repo demonstrates how you can apply the right design patterns to make your work easier.

## Introduction

In software development, design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems. They provide a proven way to structure your code, making it more efficient and easier to maintain. This repository walks you through different scenarios where design patterns can simplify complex problems. From handling API responses and running test cases to generating tokens, youâ€™ll find various examples of how to apply design patterns in practical situations.

## Why Design Patterns Matter

Without structure, code becomes messy, hard to read, and even harder to modify. Imagine a scenario where three developers work on the same problem but in different ways, leading to a codebase that becomes a nightmare to maintain. This is why design patterns are importantâ€”they help to organize the code in such a way that it is more modular, readable, and scalable. 

This repository showcases:
- How design patterns can avoid spaghetti code.
- Examples of real-world issues solved with patterns.
- Tips on selecting the right design pattern for your problem.

## Design Patterns Covered

This repository demonstrates several design patterns, broken down into three categories:

1. **Creational Patterns**  
   - **Singleton Pattern**: Ensure a class has only one instance, useful for managing resources like API tokens.
   - **Factory Pattern**: Dynamically create objects without specifying the exact class.

2. **Structural Patterns**  
   - **Adapter Pattern**: Connect different interfaces or APIs in a cohesive manner.
   - **Decorator Pattern**: Add functionality to objects without modifying their structure.

3. **Behavioral Patterns**  
   - **Observer Pattern**: Manage communication between objects in an event-driven system.
   - **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**: Delegate tasks along a chain of handlers.
   - **Strategy Pattern**: Encapsulate algorithms within classes, making them interchangeable.

## Code Structure

The code will be organized into folders by pattern type, making it easy to navigate and understand the structure of each example.

```
â”œâ”€â”€ creational/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ singleton.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ factory.js
â”œâ”€â”€ structural/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ adapter.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ decorator.js
â”œâ”€â”€ behavioral/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ observer.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ chain-of-responsibility.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ strategy.js
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

Each folder contains code examples that demonstrate the use of the specific pattern. The examples come with comments to help you understand the logic behind them.
